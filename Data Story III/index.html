	<h3>Estimated Injuries of 2016</h3>
	<p>Since the 1990s, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has recorded and published emergency room visits from 100 hospitals in a probability sample, and the data can be used to project a national estimate. </p>
	<p>The study records and estimates the nature of each ER visit, highlighting patient age and gender. The CPSC also provides narratives for each ER visit, which are short summaries of the patient and injury.</p>
	<p>In the year 2016, the CPSC estimated a total <span>14,279,755</span><br>emergency room visits nation-wide.</p>

		<h5>Projected Emergency Room visits over 2015</h5>
		<p class = "writing">There's someting deeply personal about peeking into peoples' ER visits. The CPSC records accidents involving harmless household items; there's even a category which includes walking into glass doors. In most of these cases, the patients were treated and released without issue - which is why I don't feel guilty reading about their slip-ups. Reading through these records is like watching clips from America's Funniest Home Videos. The image of the injuries makes you both grimace and chuckle.</p>
	</div>

	<div id = "article-right">
		<p class = "writing">It's interesting to compare injuries from certain products to men versus women: all products overall, sports items, regular household items and children's products. While some of the categories show no difference between men and women, sports injuries occur significantly more to men while kitchen appliances and blankets (yes, blankets) cause more injuries to women.</p>
